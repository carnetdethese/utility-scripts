## Description of scripts

### Copy markdown link

This script is meant to be used in Tampermonkey (or any other scripting tool for your favourite web browser, if you can adapt it). It adds a button at the bottom of your window, so you can easily copy and paste a Markdown link. I wanted to have a quick way to grab url links for Obsidian, so here it is. 

You could, if the green color of the button makes you sick, change it with the `button.style.backgroundColor` variable.
